#  Simulation of Model 4 from “Simulation with Arena” Using AnyLogic


This project is a simulation of Model 4 from the book Simulation with Arena (authored by W. David Kelton, Randall P. Sadowski, and Nancy B. Zupick) implemented using the AnyLogic simulation software. The model is designed to introduce the concepts of simulation and system performance analysis, recreated here using AnyLogic’s modern tools and capabilities.

# Project Description
In this project:

Model 4 from the book Simulation with Arena has been recreated.
The primary purpose of this simulation is to analyze process flows, queue management, and system performance.
The project utilizes AnyLogic, a powerful simulation tool that combines discrete-event simulation (DES) with system dynamics (SD) and agent-based modeling (ABM).
Project Contents
# The repository includes:

AnyLogic Model File: The main simulation model file with the .alp extension, which can be opened in AnyLogic.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Images and Charts: Screenshots of the simulated model and analysis results.
Documentation: Additional details about the model logic, simulation methodology, and results.
Prerequisites
# To run this project, you need:

AnyLogic Software (version 8 or higher).

Basic knowledge of discrete-event simulation and modeling principles.

# How to Run
To execute the model:

Open the AnyLogic software.
Load the model file (keltonBook4.alp) into AnyLogic.
Run the simulation and observe the results.
